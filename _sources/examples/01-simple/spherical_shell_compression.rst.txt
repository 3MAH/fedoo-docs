Create a simple sphere mesh using pyvista.

    spherical_shell_compression.py:24: Argument 'radius' must be passed as a keyword argument to function 'Sphere'.
    From version 0.50, passing this as a positional argument will result in a TypeError.

Define a linear isotropic material and an homogeneous shell section

    shell_section = fd.constitutivelaw.ShellHomogeneous("Material", thickness)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 33-35

Define the weakform and associated assembly for plate model
For plate elements, we first need to create a 3D modeling space

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 35-40

.. code-block:: Python


    fd.ModelingSpace("3D")
    wf = fd.weakform.PlateEquilibrium(shell_section)
    solid_assembly = fd.Assembly.create(wf, mesh)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 41-45

Select mesh elements where we will apply the pressure.
The mesh.find_elements method is used with an arbitrary exression.
Here we select all elements whose z coordinates are less that 3mm from
minimal or maximal z value (sphere extremity along the z axis.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 45-50

.. code-block:: Python


    boundaries = mesh.find_elements(
        f"Z>{mesh.bounding_box.zmax-3} or Z<{mesh.bounding_box.zmin+3}"
    )








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 51-54

Now we build the pressure assembly by extracting the surface mesh.
The pressure assembly is then added to the solid_assembly to form
the global assembly.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 54-61

.. code-block:: Python


    pressure_assembly = fd.constraint.Pressure(
        mesh.extract_elements(boundaries),
        pressure,
    )
    assembly = solid_assembly + pressure_assembly








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 62-69

Define a linear analysis and solve the problem.

.. note::
   Here we don't need to add other boundary conditions. The rigid body
   displacements and rotations of the sphere aren't constrained but the solver
   find a solution that is unique in terms of strain and stress (but not
   for displacements or rotations)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 69-73

.. code-block:: Python


    pb = fd.problem.Linear(assembly)
    pb.solve()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 74-79

Extract the results:
position = 1 is set for the surface along the positif direction of the
normal vector (0 is the mean plane). The strains and stresses components are
defined in the element local coordinate system
(mesh.get_element_local_frame()).
